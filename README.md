## ðŸš€ Introduction

Airbnb's first appearance in 2008 has a disruptive change in hospitality and accommodation around the world. This tutorial gives you basic information about Airbnb operations and its relationship with customers (hosts and travellers). All the source codes will be done in Python with emphasis on Data Visualization and Data Analysis.

## â¬‡ Project Plan

The project will answer the follow questions with data analysis:
- Is there any correlation between price and number of reviews, rating scores, host response rate, or number of bedrooms of a house?
- What is the price distribution of Airbnb listings?
- Which locations in NYC have the highest price and rating scores?
- What are the popular room types and house types in NYC?
- What time of the year are AirBnBs most popular in New York City? Are specific holiday seasons more popular?
- Can we predict the rental price given several features? Which kind of model will we use to predict the most accurately?
- What can we understand from the customers' reviews? What changes should we make to make them happier?
- How do NYC Airbnb listings compare with Boston or San Francisco's ones?
